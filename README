Range::Object version 0.9
=========================

This suite of modules implements unified API for manipulating ranges of
objects of different kinds.

In terms of Range::Object namespace, a range is defined as a set of items,
either disjointed (individual) or contiguous, or a combination of separate
items and ranges. Intersecting or adjacent ranges are not supported directly
and will be collapsed silently into wider contiguous range.

Although Range::Object descendant module can store any number of separate
values (objects) and ranges, it is optimized for storing contiguous ranges
of arbitrary length with minimal memory and storage footprint; the other
effect of this being fast serialization and deserialization of Range::Object
instances. It cannot come without cost though; Range::Object uses more
CPU cycles than similar hash-based modules.

Good application for this kind of object storage can be an implementation
of user permission tables for large number of objects, especially if such
permissions are typically assigned in large contiguous ranges. For
example, if an user has read permission for objects 1-10000 and write
permission for objects 1-100, 200-300 and 1000-9999, storing these
identificators as hash keys is memory expensive, and can become
prohibive when number of tables and users increase. Compared to that
approach, Range::Object can be a reasonable compromise between memory
and CPU utilization.

This module also comes useful for user input validation when dealing with
HTML forms or something similar.
